## Pokemon Types Radial Tidy tree
https://creative-exercise-francescodm6.glitch.me/
- D3 (radial tiny tree)
- demonstrating a relational diagram of pokemon and their types, from Awesome JSON datasets, limited to a small number for visual clarity
- instead of acquiring data from a local json, fetches data from PokeAPI
- using css styles with shadcn from previous assignments
- based on the example, children at certain levels should all be at the same level. however, observing that the type weaknesses would be on the same level as pokemon, the depth was changed for uniqueness
- my favorite feature is the capabillity to hover over a pokemon's node, which displays the pokemon's sprite, which i decided to add because i thought it was wasteful for that data to be present in the original data and go unused
